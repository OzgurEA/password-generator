Python Password Generator
This repository contains a Python script that generates secure random passwords with customizable length and character composition. The password generator script allows users to specify the desired number of letters, numbers, and symbols in their passwords, providing a flexible way to generate strong and unique passwords tailored to individual needs.

Features
Customizable password length: Users can input the desired length of the password, allowing for passwords of varying lengths based on specific requirements.
Character composition control: The script provides options to include letters (both lowercase and uppercase), numbers, and symbols in the generated password. Users can determine the number of characters from each category to include, providing flexibility in password complexity.
Randomization: The password generator utilizes the randomization capabilities of Python to ensure that the generated passwords are unpredictable and resistant to brute force attacks.
Simple and intuitive usage: The script prompts users for input on the desired length and character composition, making it easy to generate passwords quickly and efficiently.
